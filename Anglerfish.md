# Anglerfish

The **Angleffish** is a derivative from the **Matchboxscope**. It has a "Angel" (German: fishing-rod) for hunting microbes, fishes, bacteria, algae...that can grow on a surface - under water! Yes! We want to capture the biofilm that will grow on transparent surfaces over time under water to get an idea what's happening. The core idea is to build an ESP32-based microscope, which fits into a watertight container. You focus it once to see the furface of the container sharp and release it into the wild, where it will capture images periodically.

While designing the Anglerfish - which actually looks like an anglerfish considering the "Angle" - we experimented with many different design configurations and consdierations.

*One way of doing it, but way too complicated*


There are great threads on building watertight assemblies using PVC tubes (LINK) or 3D printed parts (LINK, PRUSA). However, one day (actually during cooking something) we came across the idea of using jars from jams.



A [quick survey](https://twitter.com/OpenUc2/status/1528406118816534529 ) led to the point that most countries have Bonne Maman jars in their supermarket shelves. An ideal starting point for frugal microscope submarines! Still curious? Continue reading! :-)

The **Anglerfish** shares many aspects with the **Matchboxscope**, hence it may be worth to also have a look [here](Matchboxscope.md)

***NEW !!!!*** We have a Youtube Video hat guides you through the process of building your own Anglerfish: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuOOWYZesqA&feature=youtu.be



# Assembly

We will give you a step-by-step guide on how to assemble the whole microscope. If anything fails or doesn't match as expected (most likely), please file an issue immediately. We will be there for you. Most of the steps below are very similar to the [Matchboxscope](Matchboxscope.md). Only the screws for focusing the sample are oriented differently.

## Components

This you will need for your device in order to work:

## Assembly Process

These are the parts you need

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_0.jpg" width="500"></a>

### Removing camera lens

Be careful! This is the most crucial part! Hold the camera sensor and unswrew the lens. Try not to touch the Flatband cable.

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_1.jpg" width="500"></a>

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_2.jpg" width="500"></a>

### Mount the camera lens in the tube

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_3.jpg" width="500"></a>

If the tube doesn't match the diameter of the lens, warm the plastic to make it bendable.

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_4.jpg" width="500"></a>

Add the camera sensor to the hole. It should be "pressfit".

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_5.jpg" width="500"></a>

The flatband has to be folded in the next step. Be careful: It may break and ruin the camera

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_6.jpg" width="500"></a>

### Assembling the case

Close the casing with M3x20 screws

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_7.jpg" width="500"></a>

For adding a "spring-loaded" mechanism, use the foam in the packaging of the ESP32 and cut a hole into the center

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_8.jpg" width="500"></a>

Add the foam to the lens-tube assembly

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_9.jpg" width="500"></a>

Add the baseplate to the JAR. This should be "press-fit"; if it doesn't work out of the box, place the jar on a hotplate (stove) and warm it up to ~50-80°C, gently push the plate as close to the glass as possible.

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_14.jpg" width="500"></a>


### Assembling the electronics (optional)

Alternatively you can use a small powerbank that fits into the assembly.

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_18.jpg" width="500"></a>

Solder a USB cable or simply two wires to the 5V/GND of the ESP32 on one end. The other end goes to the large USB or 5V/GND of the TP5400. This is the supply voltage.

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_12.jpg" width="500"></a>

The lithium-ion battery will be connected to the TP5400 input (B+/B-)

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_13.jpg" width="500"></a>

Make sure you do not create a shortcut! => Place everything in plastic bag.


### Microscope in the bottle => focus!

Mount the camera assembly to the jar baseplate:

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_10.jpg" width="500"></a>

Adjust the focus by first turning on the ESP32 and connect to the Wi-Fi (`SSID: Matchboxscope`). Open the page http://192.168.4.1. Make a mark on the glass surface in front of the objective lens (has to be removed afterwards!). Turn the three focusing screws such that you create a sharp image of the mark on the glass.

### Final assembly

Put everything together and close the lid. Only connect the USB cable if you are close to your experiment.

<a href="#logo" name="logo"><img src="./IMAGES/anglerfish/anglerfish_16.jpg" width="500"></a>

Mount the LED with hotglue (use a lot)


## Setting up the software
